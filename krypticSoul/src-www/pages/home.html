    <p>
        If you that want to know in detail who Kryptic Soul is please check out the page on my Personal Information.&nbsp; 
        For those that are just interested in the small version I will try to sum it up here.&nbsp; 
        I am a guy who has trouble sharing his emotions in a normal manner, so I write and sing about them.&nbsp; 
        Because I have problems bearing my soul the message is often cryptic and only understandable to myself after 
        I have bled the pen dry.&nbsp; For these reasons I have been writing music and poetry for many years now.&nbsp; 
        I have put together a collection of Poems and Songs into a book that I have given to my family members and 
        I have included here some of those selections.&nbsp; I have also shared my works with the world by 
        posting on poetry sites, but I wanted to create a central location for all of the creative work that 
        I may do in my life and thus Kryptic Soul was born.

    <p>
        I have gathered here a collection of things going on in my life as well as my poetry.&nbsp; 
        If you like any of the poetry here feel free to take a copy of it, but if you use it 
        in any professional or personal works please remember to credit me and email me so that I 
        know my work has been appreciated.&nbsp; However, if you would like a copy of the book I mentioned above 
        please send me an email request and I will get you the information on how you can purchase one.&nbsp; 
        You can find my email under&nbsp; 
        <a href="../pages/personal.html#_Contact_Information">contact information on the Personal Information page</a>.&nbsp; 
        For those of you who have your own poetry sites, please send me an email and I will add your link to my links page.&nbsp; 
        Also if you have any poetry you would like me to post here send it to me, as I will be adding another page for 
        submitted works of visiting poets.
