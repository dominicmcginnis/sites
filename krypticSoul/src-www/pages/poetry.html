    <h3>
    This first poem is one I wrote while thinking about the feelings you get when you go to a dance club.&nbsp;
    This is a poem I submitted to poetry.com as an entry for a monthly poetry contest. 
    </h3>
 
    <h4> Lord of the Dance </h4> 
    <p>
        I sit amongst them in a world of darkness with swirling lights</br>
        High above stands their lord on a platform erected to the gods</br>
        Spinning and preaching their words of praise</br>
        They dance around and howl into the night</br>
        As if in some kind of trance and yet as I watch I suddenly feel compelled to join</br>
        It is as if the lord on the platform were a wizard casting a mighty spell on those below him</br>
        And I one of them, though not a follower cannot resist the call</br>
        So I rise and join in the dance</br>
        And as I dance I feel at peace, the world flashing by in a swirl of colors</br>
        The music giving me clarity and putting me into some kind of trance</br>
        Now I understand what it is like to let go</br>
        And why it is that they worship him so.</br>
    <p>
 

    <h3>
        This second poem was one I wrote on my first work assignment away from home.&nbsp; 
        Its about how being away from my Fiancé made me feel.
    </h3>

    <h4> A Night Away </h4>
    <p>
        I was glad to finally arrive</br>
        The night was hot and heavy</br>
        But while it was comfortable inside</br>
        I couldn't seem to relax</br>
        I looked out the window</br>
        To view the magical night</br>
        It was then I realized</br>
        It would not be perfect without you by my side.</br></br>

        I laid down on the bed</br>
        All thoughts on you being so distant</br>
        That my head was filled with dread</br>
        My heart felt so spent filling the void</br>
        I tossed and turned an empty shell, dead</br>
        Sleep would not take me this annoyed</br></br>

        Gazing in the dark</br>
        I could see your face, an angel</br>
        In my heart she left her mark</br>
        Leaving me filled with peace</br>
        And sleep welcomed me.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        For more of my poetry check back regularly.&nbsp;  I will try to post a new one every week and
        I may even post some of the song lyrics that will be on a few of my upcoming CD projects.
