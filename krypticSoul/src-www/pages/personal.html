    <h2>Biographical Information</h2>
    
    <p>
        I reside in Walnut Creek, CA and my Fiancé lives in Pleasanton, CA.&nbsp;
        We are but a drive away from the hip city of San Francisco, CA where the party goes all night long.&nbsp;
        My family is scattered about the San Francisco, CA Bay Area, with my parents living in Fremont, CA.&nbsp;
        Both of my parents (Robert and Mary McGinnis) are teachers in Union City, CA where my mother teaches Math and 
        Science and my Father is the Activity Director as well as teaching Leadership, Drama, PE, and Computers.&nbsp;
        On the weekends my Father is also a DJ.&nbsp; He typically DJ’s for weddings, anniversaries, and holiday parties; 
        but he has DJ’d for the school dances when needed.&nbsp; He used to be the lead singer of a band 
        (think the Wedding Singer), but then when DJ’s became popular and were on the rise in the late 80’s 
        he started losing business so he decided to go into DJ’ing when there were no opportunities for the bands work 
        so he could bring in the extra money.&nbsp; If ever you want to hire him his production name is DJ Moon Magic 
        and you can reach him at 1-510-792-0572.  Or you may want to check out the website I have created for him at
