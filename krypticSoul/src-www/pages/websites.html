        In here I have listed a set of websites that belong to my friends and family members.&nbsp; 
        Some of these websites I have helped to design and create.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy browsing them and exploring their wonders.

        This website is for one of my good buddies Phil Wartena, the bestman at my wedding.&nbsp; 
        He is an awsome guy and he can really take some cool pictures.&nbsp; Photography has been his 
        dream since highschool and now he has started a collective for upcoming photographers to showcase their stuff.&nbsp;
        I am a regular when it comes to this site, its constantly changing and there is always some good artwork to view.&nbsp;
