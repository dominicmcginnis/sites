	      <td>
		A. I use CD players to DJ with, but I also bring a cassette player in case you have 
		anything on tape that you would like me to play.  I have enough speakers to cover any 
		size of event from small to large.  I also have a few lighting effects (rope lights, disco 
		lights, disco balls, etc...) and a fog machine, but I don't bring them to all shows unless 
		they are needed.

		A. If you need more lighting than what I own, I know of some friends that I can borrow 
		it from to cover your needs or I will buy it before the event if I need to.  
		Either way I will make sure that I have what you want to make your night special.

		A. Yes, I do have back up equipment that I can bring if needed.  But usually if there is a 
		problem I will know before the event starts, so that I can have it resolved without delaying the event.
