		  	   There are many rumors as to how he got his nickname, Moon, some even dating back to his college 
		           partying days, but we will leave that up to your imagination.

			   What is most important is that Moon is a master in the art of entertaining!  He has been in the
			   business of entertaining people for over 30 years, of which more than 18 have been as a DJ.  
			   You may be wondering what he did before becoming a DJ.  It was not earning his nickname, but 
			   rather dazzling people with the sound of his amazing voice.  That's right before becoming a DJ, 
			   he was the lead singer of Moon Magic, a band that was highly praised for all things involving 
			   live music.

			   I know what you are thinking.  With all of that experience Moon must be at least 45 years old, 
			   how could he possibly still be in touch with the younger generation?  The truth is that Moon is
			   over 50 years old, but he has kids that are in their 20's and more importantly; Moon works as a  
			   teacher during the day at a middle school where he is also the activity director.  By being older 
			   and working with young kids it keeps him in touch with what the younger generation wants, the 
			   older generation likes, and allows him to bring the class your special event deserves.

			   Moon is a man who loves his trade, both teaching and especially entertaining.  He is a great
			   master of ceremonies who can provide a wonderful experience for your special occasion.
